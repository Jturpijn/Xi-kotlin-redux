# Thesis project: kotlin-redux
For this project I'm developing two approaches on developing with kotlin JS. 
The first approach regards this repository. The approach entails developing a wrapper to include the redux and redux-saga libraries.
By using different sources, I'm trying to create a payment system which uses redux as a state manager and redux-saga to handle async actions with side effects.

## Sources
* https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-redux

## Build
Clone the project, navigate to ```xi_kotlin\build\js\packages\xi_kotlin_redux```. This is where the transpiled js script is located. Use the ```node ./kotlin\xi_kotlin_redux.js``` command to run the script.
